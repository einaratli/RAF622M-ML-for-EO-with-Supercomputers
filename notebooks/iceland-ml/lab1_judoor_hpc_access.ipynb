    "## Section 1: What is Judoor and Why Do We Need It?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "**Judoor** is the unified user portal for accessing Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) resources. It manages:\n",
    "- User authentication\n",
    "- Project memberships\n",
    "- Compute time allocations\n",
    "- Resource access permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why HPC for Machine Learning?\n",
    "- **Large Datasets:** Sentinel-2 imagery can be terabytes in size\n",
    "- **GPU Acceleration:** Deep learning models require GPU compute\n",
    "- **Parallel Processing:** Data preprocessing can be parallelized across many CPU cores\n",
    "- **Storage:** Centralized storage for shared datasets and models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Resources\n",
    "- **Project ID:** `training2600`\n",
    "- **Available Partitions:**\n",
    "  - `JURECA-DC_CPU`: 128 cores/node, 512 GB RAM\n",
    "  - `JURECA-DC_GPU`: 4x NVIDIA A100 GPUs/node, 40 GB VRAM each"

    "3. Fill in your details:\n",
    "   - Use your university email (hi.is domain preferred)\n",
    "   - Create a strong password (min 12 characters)\n",
    "   - Complete all required fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Email Verification\n",
    "1. Check your inbox for verification email\n",
    "2. Click the verification link\n",
    "3. Log in with your new credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Join Training Project\n",
    "1. After logging in, click: https://judoor.fz-juelich.de/projects/join/training2600\n",
    "2. Read and accept the usage policy\n",
    "3. Click **\"Join Project\"**\n",
    "4. Wait for approval (usually instant for training projects)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Common Issues\n",
    "- **Verification email not received:** Check spam folder, wait 5-10 minutes\n",
    "- **Join link doesn't work:** Ensure you're logged in first\n",

    "## Section 3: SSH Key Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why SSH Keys?\n",
    "SSH keys provide secure, passwordless authentication to HPC systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Generate SSH Key (if you don't have one)\n",
    "Open a terminal on your local machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Generate ED25519 key (recommended)\n",
    "ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@hi.is\" -f ~/.ssh/jureca_key\n",
    "\n",
    "# Alternative: Generate RSA key (4096 bits)\n",
    "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@hi.is\" -f ~/.ssh/jureca_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Press Enter** when asked for passphrase (or set one for extra security)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Copy Public Key\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Display your public key\n",
    "cat ~/.ssh/jureca_key.pub\n",
    "```\n",
    "Copy the entire output (starts with `ssh-ed25519` or `ssh-rsa`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Upload to Judoor\n",
    "1. Go to: https://judoor.fz-juelich.de/\n",
    "2. Navigate to **\"JURECA Manage SSH-Keys\"** section\n",
    "3. In order to make changes with your account you might need to confirm your 2nd authentication factor\n",
    "4. Paste your public key in the **\"Your public key and options string\"** section\n",
    "5. Copy the IP Address range suggested to you by JUDoor, or if you are on the university network use the University of Iceland IP range:\n",
    "\n",
    "Owner: Rannsokna- og Háskólanet Íslands hf\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: 130.208.0.0/16\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Add your key in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "from=\"130.208.0.0/16\" <your public key>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Configure SSH Client\n",
    "Create/edit `~/.ssh/config` on your local machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Host jureca\n",
    "    HostName jureca.fz-juelich.de\n",
